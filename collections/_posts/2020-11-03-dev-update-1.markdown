We're always working on making the protocol better and more stable. As we work on these updates, we would love to share the information with the community.

Today, we're starting with our first bi-weekly dev update. These updates will consist of the latest information, releases, and insights from the dev team at bZx.


## Updates:


1. **Explorer Liquidations Page**

    We've improved on the page loading speed for the [explorer page](https://explorer.bzx.network/), [Fulcrum stats page](https://app.fulcrum.trade/stats), and the [Fulcrum trade page](https://app.fulcrum.trade/trade).

2. **Initial Collateralization Percentage**

    For borrowing on [Torque](https://torque.loans/) you can now choose the initial collateralization percentage.

3. **CHI Token support for the Explorer**

    You can use the gas token when you want to liquidate the loan. We've also added a transaction indicator for liquidations.

4. **AAVE and UNI tokens**

    You can now use the newly listed tokens on Fulcrum and Torque for trading, lending, and borrowing.

5. **Fulcrum Price Formula Update**

    We updated the price formula for Fulcrum based on the maintenance margin/liquidity.



On the [community call that concluded on Friday, Oct 30th](https://youtu.be/1lOSOoEdg-Q), Roman from our team also explained about Flash Loans. You can check the sample mentioned on the call [here](https://github.com/bZxNetwork/flashloan-sample).

Apart from the above updates, we've also made several tweaks and improvements under the hood to make the experience smoother.
