Hey bZx’ers, check out our monthly update for all of the latest work from the bZx team!

With another month behind us we’ve got a brand new public API, an update on how we’re handling the coming SAI shutdown, and more.

# bZx Updates

## Public API Now Available

We’ve got data! Our newly released API lets you pull a variety of information on bZx, Fulcrum, and Torque, including:
- Supply APR  
- Borrow APR for Fulcrum and Torque
- Liquidity and TVL
- iTokens prices
- Collateral estimates on borrowing

Check it out for yourself at [https://api.bzx.network/](https://api.bzx.network/).

## Shutting Down SAI
MakerDAO’s single-collateral DAI (SAI) system is in the process of shutting down. The community has signaled its support in deactivating the price oracle, setting a shutdown date for May 12.

All outstanding loans have been paid and the team has disabled the SAI <-> DAI bridge and lending on Fulcrum, however, users can still unlend SAI at their convenience.
