We had a very busy November at bZx, so here is our monthly newsletter ‚ÄúThe Shipping Manifest‚Äù with key takeaways.

## TVL Growth üìàüìàüìà

In November we achieved another all-time-high TVL in ETH, according to defipulse.com stats, with 100% growth over the month:

Fulcrum's trading volume in ETH on KyberNetwork spiked up to 26% compared to the previous month.

## Visual Identity Updated

We updated our visual identity and redesigned the [bZx protocol website](https://bzx.network). Our new branding aimed to strengthen brand recognition for products built with the bZx protocol. You can find our media assets on [this page](/media-assets). We also migrated our twitter handle to a new one: [@bzxHQ](https://twitter.com/bzxHQ)

## Multi Collateral DAI on Fulcrum and Torque

One of the most important events past month was the MakerDAO transition to a Multi Collateral DAI. We published our [MCD transition plan](/blog/mcd-transition-plan), and already enabled new DAI markets on Fulcrum for trading and lending:

New DAI enabled as well on Torque for borrowing and to use as collateral in loans:

Lenders on Fulcrum could easily migrate from SAI to a new DAI with a single click:

Thanks to DexWallet team for collaborating with us on that. This feature made possible with [DexWallet Recipes](https://recipes.dexwallet.io), read more about [iSAI to iDAI migration recipe](https://medium.com/dexlab-io/fulcrum-isai-to-idai-migration-recipe-5cf36b53e7a9).

Fulcrum & Torque listed on Loanscan.io with new DAI rates.
