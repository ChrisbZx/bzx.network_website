March has been a month of heads-down work for the bZx team, from deploying new code to communicating all of our latest updates to the community.

Given everything happening with the Coronavirus, we feel fortunate to have remote operations already in place and the team would like to extend its sympathy to everyone affected by what’s happening.

Read on for the latest from bZx, updates from the bZx blog, and links to some of the excellent media coverage we’ve received over the last month.


## bZx Updates

The team pushed our audited changes into deployment on March 9, enabling traders to close their positions without having to contact customer support.

bZx is now integrated with Chainlink to protect against oracle exploit attacks and all of our code has now been audited. Read more in our [joint announcement](https://twitter.com/chainlink/status/1237201260803239936) with Chainlink. 

Our initial [protocol audit](https://github.com/mattdf/audits/blob/master/bZx/bzx-audit.pdf), as well as the recent [flash loans audit](https://bzx.network/pdfs/CertiK%20Verification%20Report%20for%20bZx.pdf) and [code audit](https://bzx.network/pdfs/CertiK%20Verification%20Report%20for%20bZx.pdf), are all publicly available.

We also plan to launch an EIP-like system for bringing new features and improvements to the protocol and publish a schedule for planned releases and response plans for dealing with unexpected situations.


## From the bZx Blog

We published two updates this month, detailing what happened in the recent exploit and our response to those events.

Cofounder Kyle Kistner [talked to Blockonomi](https://blockonomi.com/defi-1inch-exchange-links-up-with-chainlink/) about our integration with Chainlink to prevent oracle manipulation attacks in the future.

In spite of the difficulties faced by those affected by the exploit, lenders experienced a silver lining as interest rates exceeded 40%, as [CEO Tom Bean shared with CoinDesk](https://www.coindesk.com/yields-of-25-to-42-lure-lenders-back-to-defi-platform-bzx).

Kyle also recently [joined a panel](https://www.pscp.tv/w/1ynJOpWWEArxR) moderated by ConsenSys Head of Global Community and Development Valeria Kholostenko for Monolith’s Digital DeFi meetup.
