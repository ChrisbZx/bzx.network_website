We're always working on improving your experience on Fulcrum and Torque through new features and enhancements to overall strengthening the protocol.

Here’s a look at some of the work we have done on the dev side in the past two weeks.


## Updates:

1. **Rollover grid to explorer**

    We have added the rollover grid to the explorer. With this, users can roll over their loans just like the liquidation.

2. **Liquidity to Fulcrum Lend and Torque Borrow tiles**

    We have enabled seeing how much liquidity is available on both Fulcrum and Torque pages. This will allow users to see the availability liquidity during the time.

3. **Alchemy badge on bZx Homepage**

    We recently added the Alchemy referral badge to the bZx homepage. You can see it at the bottom of the page [here.](https://bzx.network/)

5. **Torque borrow page performance**

    We’ve improved the overall page performance of the Torque Borrow page. The tiles within the borrow page are now loading faster.

6. **Front-interest bug fixed**

    Previously, when attempting to front more interest, the UI showed that the action failed. We have fixed this big and now users will be able to front more interest in Torque.

7. **Color coding to the front end values**

    This text under the percentage value are now color-coded. It will show green if it's up and  red if it's down.




Apart from the above updates, we have added stability tweaks and other performance enhancements to make sure everything's running as smooth as possible.
