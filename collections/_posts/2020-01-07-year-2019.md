This past year 2019 has been absolutely fascinating for Ethereum, and specifically, the DeFi space. With as per today $670M locked within the Ethereum DeFi ecosystem and more than 100% growth since the beginning of 2019, we can now say for sure that DeFi is the killer application for Ethereum.

We deployed our protocol to mainnet late 2018, when we were the first margin protocol on mainnet, but had only been adopted by a single 0x relay that had difficulties to bootstrap open order books and had basically no liquidity.

2019 was the year of building for us here at bZx. After our deployment on mainnet, we noticed that the developer’s curiosity to build on a recently new deployed protocol was limited, as the bear market probably hit a lot of developers as well. For this reason, we decided first to develop a bunch of dApps ourselves, which are built on top of the protocol.

## Fulcrum

In March 2019, we published an [introduction article](https://bzx.network/blog/introducing-fulcrum-tokenized-margin-made-dead-simple) to describe the idea of Fulcrum: it was the first and only completely trustless platform for margin; it does not use centralized price feeds or centrally administered margin calls. It is permissionless and rent-free; there are no fees and no accounts. Fulcrum is built on the bZx base protocol and extends the protocol by allowing both loans and margin positions to be tokenized. In June, we went live with Fulcrum, where everyone was able to lend, leverage, and short the assets ETH, wBTC, ZRX, KNC, BAT, REP, DAI, and USDC. Upon our launch, we had an instant liquidity of [$750,000](https://bzx.network/blog/fulcrum-launches-with-over-750-000-of-liquidity) as multiple liquidity providers were willing to supply liquidity as from our start.

We keep working on improving Fulcrum, and gathered feedback from our users. Upcoming months we will work on improving the user experience, mainly by:
- improving the charts of our assets;
- introducing limit and stop-loss orders via 0x v3.0;
- adding DEX aggregators to reduce slippage;
- including trading history.

## Torque

When we were developing Fulcrum, we already had the second product in mind: Torque. We had an idea to be the first borrowing platform with indefinite-term loans and fixed interest rates. We published an introduction article at the end of August, which can be found [here](https://bzx.network/blog/introducing-torque-borrowing-made-simple).

The main advantages of Torque are: non-custodial, no penalties, fixed interest rates, flexible repayments, and universal wallet access. Since Torque draws from Fulcrum’s liquidity pools, it had deep liquidity from day one.

## bZx ecosystem growth

Our friends at Kyber publish a monthly report about stats and developments within the DeFi ecosystem, or specifically about their integrations. July was the first month that Kyber (our on-chain liquidity protocol) published something about Fulcrum:

We closed our first month of Fulcrum with $840,680 volume, and a locked value of around $1,000,000. Although volumes across the crypto world have dropped sharply since mid-July, this hasn’t been enough to slow down the growth trends in the DeFi space. We closed July with $1,401,936 volume (growth of 66,8%). As we noticed an increasing demand for trading $LINK on a decentralized way, we decided to add $LINK as a first newly added asset after our launch:

Since that moment, we have seen a lot of trading activity from the LINK community, for which we are really grateful. As per today, LINK is #3 in assets with the highest TLV. Although there was a strong market decline in August, we were still growing both in ETH as in Dollar value. We closed August with an increase of 38% (in ETH) and 15% (in $).

During the summer, we noticed that bZx (and Fulcrum) were getting a lot of attention from teams active in the space, and people who are following the DeFi space. Some of the tweets during that period:

The attention for our first launched dApp is something we noticed in our upcoming month volumes as well. We were really excited when Kyber published the September ecosystem report. Our volumes grew from $1,605,330 to $2,829,254 (+76%) and 8,090 ETH to 15,470 ETH (+91%). This month we were 47% of all DeFi traffic through Kyber Network!

October was a month where our volumes stabilized, with a comparative trading volume in ETH as the month before, and a small decrease in $ value. During November, our volumes picked up again, as we increased 12% in ETH, and 27% in $ value.

Another metric that has been monitored widely by the DeFi community is the total locked value (TLV). These are assets locked within the protocol/dApp.

The 18th of November was a big milestone for everyone: MakerDAO was transitioning away from Single Collateral DAI toward Multi Collateral DAI. There was a lot of uncertainty within the DeFi community about the impact of this transitioning. To make this process smooth for our own users, we included a single-click conversion method from SAI -> DAI. Worth to mention that we believe in decentralization and economic incentives (such as higher APR for DAI), so we are not enforcing SAI to DAI migration, and let our users choose when they want to do it.

After the transition to Multi Collateral DAI, a governance round of MakerDAO increased the DSR rate from 2% to 4%. Which brought the DSR close to the lending rates of protocols such as bZx. As our protocol is suitable for money legos, we initiated a transaction that updated the iDAI logic contract. Going forward, DAI in Fulcrum lending pools that haven’t been loaned out are mint to [Chai](https://chai.money). This means that DAI that isn’t being utilized in margin trades or loans is earning the Maker DSR (4% APY currently) - and our users are thus earning the 4% APY + Fulcrum’s own native rate:

Current_Supply_Rate = iDAI_Native_Supply_Rate + DSR * (1 - current_utilization)

Kyle Kistener [shared his thoughts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHrFatzOkUw) about the future of MakerDAO and multi collateral DAI migration on a Panel Discussion with Rune Christensen, founder of MakerDAO.

Since this innovative integration, we have been leading the table of the highest interest rate, bringing our TLV > $4,000,000 (the day of writing: $4,800,000).

## Other integrations

Besides the launch of our own dApps, we have been working on multiple integrations. Two major examples of our integrations are DeversiFi and Augur:
- DeversiFi was the rebrand of Ethfinex - bZx/Fulcrum is included as two of their new upcoming features: [Decentralized Margin & Decentralized Lending](https://blog.ethfinex.com/introducing-deversifi/)

Decentralized Margin: Using our protocol, they are preparing to add leveraged trading to the DeversiFi experience. The margin trading experience using Fulcrum will be three-clicks simple!

Decentralized Lending: As with margin, they will be using the bZx Fulcrum protocol to provide lending features on DeversiFi. Like margin, lending will be designed with ease-of-use in mind, allowing traders to lend directly within the Deversifi interface.

- Augur will include bZx in their upcoming Augur v2 launch. bZx is a natural fit for Augur, since it is more decentralized than other lending solutions in the industry. It is fully non-custodial, with funds escrowed in smart contracts, and it uses both decentralized price feeds and margin calls. The bZx widget will be available in the UI for sufficiently liquid scalar markets on Augur and let traders lend and borrow Dai or outcome shares. Both lenders and borrowers can create orders with [their chosen terms](https://www.augur.net/blog/margin-lending/).

## bZx ecosystem

During September 2019, we hosted several bounties via Kyber for the #KyberDeFi Hackaton. A lot of different teams have used bZx in a certain way, and awesome ideas and products came out of this. A few examples are included below:

[DeFiZap](https://defizap.com): DeFiZap allows you to allocate your assets across multiple DeFi protocols in one transaction to save time and gas. One of their most recent Zaps was the “DAI Leverage Liquidity Pool” which allocates 33% of the funds to a 2x ETH Long exposure, powered by Fulcrum;

[dDAI](https://ddai.dexwallet.io): With dDAI, you can earn interest with smart DeFi Recipes. dDAI is a token which is 1:1 redeemable and backed by DAI. dDAI enables users to earn interest from lending out DAI on Fulcrum, and reinvest that interest automatically into any other asset class using ‘DeFi recipes’

[Structured](https://structuredeth.com): Structured is a simple yet powerful platform that automates the packaging of DeFi products into portfolios. Users are able to select a portfolio that matches their risk tolerance and reward expectations, and purchase that portfolio in seconds, without custodians or brokers.

## Team
Since we launched the first two dApps, received a lot of applications for collaboration or integrations, we noticed that the pressure on the current core team was increasing massively. For this reason, we expanded our team with three new members:
- Boris Shevchenko (full-stack developer): Boris has more than 12 years of full-stack software development for a super wide range of industries. He is actively contributing to the crypto community for three years, developing first-class Ethereum blockchain decentralized applications & autonomous organizations.
- Nick Sawinyh (Head of Marketing): Growth focused Product Manager with more than ten years of experience in the software industry, and a proven passion for developing innovative solutions that combine cutting-edge technology with a deep understanding of customers’ needs. Nick has an extensive background in both digital marketing and agile development of customer-facing web apps.
- Keval Sheth (full-stack developer): Keval Sheth is a Full Stack Developer at bZx, where he manages web application platform of Torque and Fulcrum. Keval has worked with reputable companies like Microsoft and Nomura and helped in building the platform that handles millions of transaction on day to day basis

## Other developments
We also achieved significant progress on an interface side. iTokens now supported by mobile wallets such as: Trust, Eidoo, DexWallet, AlphaWallet, and DeFi focused dashboards such as Zerion and DeFiSaver. Also, we implemented mobile-friendly layouts for Torque and Fulcrum.

We spent a significant amount of time on fundamental research in DeFi space this year and created a [framework for classifying lending protocols.](https://bzx.network/blog/how-decentralized-is-defi-a-framework-for-classifying-lending-protocols)   

The article has now been an industry-standard if it comes down to comparing lending protocols and assessing the levels of decentralization between the protocols.

Another research article we published this year was an overview of the [different types of DAI](https://bzx.network/blog/a-tour-of-the-varieties-of-dai) (including our own iDAI).

## Going forward

We got several pillars as a focus area for 2020, which are summarised below:
- Increase the awareness of bZx, Fulcrum and Torque;
- Add more liquidity for our users, which will reduce slippage and improve trading experiences;
- Keep updating and improving Fulcrum and Torque;
- Improve the utility of the $BZRX token (we will publish an article soon about our governance model, staking and it’s incentives to stake);
- We have another dApp in the making which we will not disclose at this time (the name we disclosed earlier in our Telegram Channel: Archimedes);

Sincerely yours,

Kyle and Tom
