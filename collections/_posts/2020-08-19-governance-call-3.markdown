We’re happy to host the next community call on Friday, August 21st. We got a huge response for the first two community calls. We have been consistently getting great feedback from the community. As we gear up for the relaunch, we want to share more updates with you and get your feedback.

During this call we will discuss:

- Security audit progress
- Community testing
- Paying down the debt
- Yield farming program
- Pitch by [Manuel Garcia](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mgarciap/) from Protofire


The community call will be recorded and uploaded to Youtube for you to watch at your own convenience. You can check the previous community call [here](https://youtu.be/a3P6_NGqPYY). Subscribe to our YouTube channel to get notified as we make the calls live.
