The new BZRX token will be launched on the Ethereum mainnet Monday, July 13th, 2020.

BZRXv1 token holders can easily migrate to the new BZRX token using our Staking Dashboard at [https://staking.bzx.network](https://staking.bzx.network).

Token holders will need to migrate in order to unlock their BZRX tokens.

As explained in [The BZRX Token Model v3](https://bzx.network/blog/bzrx-token), 20% of the token supply will be distributed through our Protocol Disbursement Program and the new BZRX token will give holders a proportional distribution of the fees assessed by the bZx Protocol.

Token holders will need to migrate to the new token by the time the platform relaunches in August to qualify for Fee Sharing.

BZRXv1 token holders will have 1 year from the launch of the new token on July 13, 2020, to migrate their holdings to BZRX tokens.

## The New BZRX Token

We request that the community support our new naming convention by ensuring all references characterize the old token as BZRXv1. The official token of bZx is now the BZRX token.
