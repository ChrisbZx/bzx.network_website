We got an overwhelming response on our first '[bZx Community Call](/blog/governance-call-recap)' we did on July 26th. We're excited to do our next community call on Friday, August 7th at 9am PDT. Please join us at this link: [https://zoom.us/j/97332777369](https://zoom.us/j/97332777369). The community call will be recorded and uploaded to Youtube for you to watch at your own convenience, if you are unable to attend.

During this call we will discuss:
- Allocation of the Ecosystem fund: increasing liquidity mining incentives?
- Next steps with the iETH rescue program
- [Trader Compensation Program](/blog/compensation-plan)
- Torque Interest Rate Strategy
- Product Spotlight: Matcha by 0x
- Community and Twitter Q&A
