Tokenized lending and margin trading just got easier than ever!

bZx is excited to share a number of updates we’ve been working on to improve the Fulcrum website and user experience.

Our team’s been hard at work updating our site design, copy, and dApp interface to deliver a more intuitive trading experience on Fulcrum and we’re excited to finally share our new features.

### Welcome to the future of tokenized trading

Fulcrum is a powerful DeFi platform enabling tokenized lending and margin trading. Lenders create iTokens to automatically earn interest and traders mint pTokens to create leveraged long or short positions on a variety of digital assets.

The platform’s new look incorporates a mobile-friendly interface with charts powered by TradingView and a clear, accessible design.

These updates make it easier for both crypto-native audiences and newcomers to make use of the platform’s unique and powerful features.

We’re also excited to announce that 5x leverage is now available on both long and short positions for all assets.* Trade ETH, WBTC, LINK, ZRX, and KNC with just a few simple clicks.

### Tether (USDT) now available on Fulcrum and Torque

In addition to updating the user interface and enabling 5x leverage, we’ve also made USDT available for lending on Fulcrum and borrowing on [Torque](https://torque.loans/#/).

USDT is the latest asset to be enabled on Fulcrum and Torque, barely a month after the [addition of Synthetix’s sUSD (January 2020).](https://bzx.network/blog/susd)

USDT is a fiat-backed stablecoin whose value is pegged to the U.S. dollar and Torque is a non-custodial platform offering fixed-rate, indefinite-term loans also built on the bZx Protocol.

### Where to get started

Less than a year after its launch in March 2019, the total value locked (TVL) in Fulcrum currently stands at $16 million.

The platform has quickly expanded to meet the needs of users and we look forward to continuing our mission to build the most decentralized lending solution possible.

Whether you want to tokenize your own investments or create unique assets to share with others, Fulcrum offers a simple, user-friendly way to trade and share digital assets.

Check out the new website at [fulcrum.trade](https://fulcrum.trade/) to get started and good luck with your tokenized lending and trading positions!
