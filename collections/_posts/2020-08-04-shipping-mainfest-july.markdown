## Project Updates

The bZx team hosted its first **Weekly Community Call** in mid-July with over 40 people in attendance. Attendees discussed how to proceed with the iETH rescue program, plans for the Governance Bootstrap Program and bZx Builder Fund, and more!

Topics we discussed:
- How to proceed with the iETH rescue program?
- The Governance Bootstrap Program, $BZRX and $vBZRX
- What to expect leading up to relaunch
- How should the bZx Builder Fund be used?
- Community AMA Microphone

In addition to continuing those discussions, we‚Äôll have a special guest from 0x speaking about [Matcha](https://matcha.xyz/), their newest exchange aggregator interface. Please see [our blog](https://bzx.network/blog/governance-call-recap) for a full recap of the first Community Call.

This past month, bZx also released its **Trader Compensation and Lender Rescue Plan** for dealing with the protocol freeze that took place on February 18, 2020.

The team is allocating 2,060,000 vesting BZRX to a fund for traders and developed options for lenders to exit the iETH pool. All details are in [the blog](https://bzx.network/blog/compensation-plan).


## bZx in the Media

BeInCrypto and DeFi Rate did a great job covering the announcement of the new Fee Sharing and Protocol Disbursement Initiatives outlined in our blog on [The BZRX Token Model v3](https://bzx.network/blog/bzrx-token).

*   DeFi Rate: [bZx Releases BZRX Governance Token Model](https://defirate.com/bzrz-token-model/)

BlockFyre released an in-depth [research report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_DskcJ01Kny6m1Q8PfIS6_vpxKDLdK7p/view) on BZRX and the bZx Protocol, highlighting the project‚Äôs value proposition and potential and exploring risks associated with the protocol.

Everipedia now contains [an entry on bZx](https://everipedia.org/wiki/lang_en/bzx-defi) detailing the tokens, team, and ecosystem of dApps that interact with the bZx Protocol.

We also want to send a sincere ‚Äúthank you‚Äù to our friends at Balancer Labs for acknowledging our integration leveraging their liquidity pools to generate fees for the bZx Protocol.
