## What is sUSD

sUSD is a token that allows the holder to collect a share of the trading fees generated from trading Synths on the [Synthetix Exchange](https://synthetix.exchange/).

Synthetix is a platform for creating synthetic assets that relies on two types of tokens to operate: the native SNX token and synthetic assets referred to as Synths.

SNX holders stake their tokens to create Synths, which can then be traded on the Synthetix Exchange. Trading Synths on the Synthetix Exchange comes with a 0.30% or 0.50% fee that gets deposited to a pool and distributed to SNX holders.

Staking SNX offers two forms of staking rewards: from trading on the Synthetix Exchange and inflation of the SNX token.

To earn rewards from trading fees, users must stake SNX tokens and mint sUSD. Users can then claim SNX as an inflationary reward and sUSD for trading fees based on the amount of sUSD the user has minted.

sUSD and SNX rewards can be claimed weekly for up to two consecutive weeks from the “Fees” screen in [Mintr](https://mintr.synthetix.io/) by users with a Collateralisation Ratio above 750%.
