## What is sUSD

sUSD is the synthetic USD stablecoin enabled by the Synthetix Protocol, for which it is also the base currency. sUSD can be used for trading on [Synthetix.Exchange](https://synthetix.exchange), the protocol’s dApp for decentralized derivatives trading.

### How Synthetix Works

Synthetix is a protocol for issuing and trading synthetic assets that relies on two types of tokens to operate: the native SNX token, which serves as collateral, and synthetic assets, referred to as Synths.

SNX holders stake their tokens to create Synths, which can then be traded on Synthetix.Exchange. Trading Synths on Synthetix.Exchange comes with a 0.30% -0.50% fee that gets deposited to a pool and distributed to SNX holders. The protocol uses a peer-to-contract trading mechanism which enables ‘infinite liquidity’ and no slippage, providing a seamless experience for traders.
