It has been an exciting week for us [relaunching the protocol](https://bzx.network/blog/bzxisback) after almost six months. We are also pumped to do the first community call after launch on Friday, September 4th at 9am PST/12pm EST (16:00 UTC)

On this call, we will discuss:

- How the launch is scaling up
- What to expect? (Dutch auction progress, BZRX trading, more assets, etc.)
- Priorities fixing bugs and issues
- Meme Farming Contest + Marketing update
- A talk by Johann Eid from ChainLink
- Q & A 


This community call will be recorded and uploaded to Youtube for you to watch at your own convenience. You can check the previous community call [here](https://youtu.be/zsBbfJrDO-s). Subscribe to our YouTube channel to get notified as we make the calls live.
