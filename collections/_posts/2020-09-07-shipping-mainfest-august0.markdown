The bZx team announced the release of its latest version of [Fulcrum](https://fulcrum.trade/) for beta testing on the Kovan Test Network earlier this month.

For a step-by-step guide to participating, please read our full blog [Announcing Community Testing for the New Fulcrum UI](https://bzx.network/blog/community-testing)  and contact the bZx team via [Telegram](https://t.me/b0xNet), or check out the [GitHub repo here](https://github.com/bZxNetwork/fulcrum_ui/issues) to join the public test phase.  


## A Primer on Staking

Staking is now live! You can now stake your tokens at [https://staking.bzx.network](https://staking.bzx.network) and the official BPT staking pool is located at: 0xe26a220a341eaca116bda64cf9d5638a935ae629.

We also published an article explaining how token holders will be able to stake BZRX and LP/BPT tokens once the platform is relaunched.

# Project Updates

The bZx team welcomes three new members to the team this month: Pratik Gandhi, Roman Iftodi, and Paris Fotis.

Pratik is our newest marketing hire, formerly working with [@NearProtocol](https://twitter.com/NEARProtocol) and [@Covalent_HQ](https://twitter.com/Covalent_HQ), Roman is a Solidity developer with a Math MSc and experience developing software used by traditional financial institutions like TDAmeritrade, and Paris is an international performer who specializes in creative marketing and project management.

Our community calls have gotten a wonderful response. In the [bZx Community Call Recap #2](https://bzx.network/blog/governance-call-recap-2), the community discussed different approaches to liquidity mining and showed support for opening the [iETH Rescue Program](https://bzx.network/blog/iETH-buyback) to traders and the general public.

Amir Bandeali, CTO of 0x, presented [Matcha](https://matcha.xyz/), a decentralized exchange aggregator with a number of exciting features available such as gas subsidies, liquidity x-ray vision, liquidity aggregation, private market makers, and limit orders.
