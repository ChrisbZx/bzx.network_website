From seeing [Taylor Swift as a DeFi project](https://twitter.com/bZxHQ/status/1292121062725914624) to [relaunching the bZx Protocol](https://bzx.network/blog/bzxisback) after months of halt, it has been an exciting month of August for the bZx team.

Read on for all of the latest updates from bZx.

## Product Update

The month of August saw the relaunch of the bZx Protocol. Read the detailed post by Kyle on [#bZxIsBack](https://bzx.network/blog/bzxisback). Fulcrum 2.0 is leaner, more elegant, and more than twice as gas efficient. Experience the new Fulcrum UI [here](https://app.fulcrum.trade/trade).

Prior to the relaunch, the bZx team announced the release of its latest version of Fulcrum for [beta testing on the Kovan Test Network](https://bzx.network/blog/community-testing).


## A Primer on Staking

Staking is now live! You can now stake your tokens at [https://staking.bzx.network](https://staking.bzx.network) and the official BPT staking pool is located at: 0xe26a220a341eaca116bda64cf9d5638a935ae629.

We also published an article explaining how token holders will be able to stake BZRX and LP/BPT tokens once the platform is relaunched.

Our community calls have gotten a wonderful response. In the [bZx Community Call Recap #2](https://bzx.network/blog/governance-call-recap-2), the community discussed different approaches to liquidity mining and showed support for opening the [iETH Rescue Program](https://bzx.network/blog/iETH-buyback) to traders and the general public.

Amir Bandeali, CTO of 0x, presented [Matcha](https://matcha.xyz/), a decentralized exchange aggregator with a number of exciting features available such as gas subsidies, liquidity x-ray vision, liquidity aggregation, private market makers, and limit orders.
